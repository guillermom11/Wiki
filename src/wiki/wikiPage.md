# Codebase Documentation# Repository Documentation

The "judini-python-main" repository contains files and folders related to demonstrating chat interactions with a CodeGPT agent, setting up the Judini Python package, defining API endpoints, and creating a CodeGPT chat interface using various functionalities and libraries.

## Folders

### judini-python-main
The "judini-python-main" folder includes files that showcase chat interactions with a CodeGPT agent, set up the Judini Python package, define API endpoints, represent classes for Agent and Document, provide utility functions for handling responses, and create a CodeGPT chat interface using Streamlit.

### judini-python-main/src
The "src" folder within "judini-python-main" contains files that import the `CodeGPTPlus` class, define base URLs for the CodeGPT beta API, store playground keys URL, and include classes for Agent, DocumentMetadata, and Document with specific attributes and functionalities for data validation and manipulation using various libraries and functions.

### judini-python-main/src/judini
The "judini" folder within "src" contains files that import the `CodeGPTPlus` class, define API endpoints, store URLs, and handle data representation, validation, manipulation, streaming responses, and JSON parsing using classes for Agent, DocumentMetadata, and Document, as well as functions for streaming and non-streaming responses.
