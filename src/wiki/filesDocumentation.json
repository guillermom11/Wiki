  "codebase-index-ts/src/queries/index": "# Documentation for `languageQueries` Assignment\n\nThe `languageQueries` assignment is a pivotal component within the repository directory found at `codebase-index-ts/src/queries/index`. This assignment leverages a dictionary that maps several programming languages to their respective query objects. Each query object is designed to manage specific queries or configurations related to its designated programming language.\n\n## Structure and Components\n\nThe `languageQueries` is structured as a dictionary, which consists of key-value pairs where the keys are the names of programming languages, and the values are the corresponding query objects. Below is an example to illustrate this structure:\n\n```python\nlanguageQueries = {\n    \"Javascript\": jsQueries,\n    \"Typescript\": tsQueries,\n    \"Python\": pyQueries,\n    \"Java\": javaQueries,\n    \"C\": cQueries\n}\n```\n\nWithin this dictionary:\n\n- **Javascript** is associated with `jsQueries`\n- **Typescript** is represented by `tsQueries`\n- **Python** is mapped to `pyQueries`\n- **Java** corresponds to `javaQueries`\n- **C** relates to `cQueries`\n\n## Detailed Description of Nodes\n\n### `jsQueries`\nThe `jsQueries` node encapsulates queries tailored for JavaScript, a versatile and widely-used language primarily for web development. This node is expected to include patterns, rules, or settings to effectively parse and interact with JavaScript code.\n\n### `tsQueries`\nSimilar to `jsQueries`, `tsQueries` contains queries specific to TypeScript. TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding static types, and the queries in this node would reflect the language's additional features and type validation.\n\n### `pyQueries`\nThe `pyQueries` node holds queries for Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and broad applicability. This node contains Python-specific rules and settings, addressing Python's unique syntax and dynamic nature.\n\n### `javaQueries`\nWithin the `javaQueries` node, you'll find queries customized for the Java programming language. Java is an object-oriented language used extensively in enterprise environments. The queries here accommodate Java's class-based structure and syntax.\n\n### `cQueries`\nThe `cQueries` node consists of queries relevant to the C programming language - a procedural language that lays the groundwork for many other languages. These queries are designed to handle C's syntax and foundational constructs.\n\n## Example Usage \n\nTo demonstrate the usage of `languageQueries`, assume that the individual queries for each language have been predefined elsewhere in the repository, such as in separate query configuration files within the `src/queries` directory:\n\n```python\njsQueries = {...}  # JavaScript-specific queries\ntsQueries = {...}  # TypeScript-specific queries\npyQueries = {...}  # Python-specific queries\njavaQueries = {...}  # Java-specific queries\ncQueries = {...}  # C-specific queries\n\nlanguageQueries = {\n    \"Javascript\": jsQueries,\n    \"Typescript\": tsQueries,\n    \"Python\": pyQueries,\n    \"Java\": javaQueries,\n    \"C\": cQueries\n}\n```\n\nThis assignment provides a centralized object for dynamically accessing language-specific queries. For instance, to retrieve Python-specific queries, one could utilize the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nlanguage = \"Python\"\nqueries = languageQueries.get(language)\n# Now 'queries' contains the Python-specific queries defined in `pyQueries`\n```\n\n## Remarks\n\n- It is essential to note that each of the nodes (e.g., `jsQueries`, `tsQueries`) should be predefined as dictionaries or objects within the repository. These definitions ensure consistency in structure and effective querying.\n- The specific details and configurations of these query nodes—while not outlined here—are expected to be consistent across the various languages they represent.\n\nThis documentation aims to elucidate the purpose, structural organization, and practical usage of the `languageQueries` assignment within the repository. For more in-depth information about the predefined queries, please refer to the corresponding query configuration files found within the `src/queries` directory.",

  "codebase-index-ts/src/utils/bitbucket/refresh-token": "# File Documentation: `refreshAccessToken`\n\n## Overview\nThe `refreshAccessToken` function is located within the repository at the path `codebase-index-ts/src/utils/bitbucket/refresh-token.ts`. This function is a critical component designed to facilitate the renewal of expired access tokens using OAuth2 refresh tokens, ensuring the continuity of authenticated sessions, particularly with services such as Bitbucket.\n\n## Function Description\nThe `refreshAccessToken` asynchronous function refreshes an expired access token using a provided refresh token. This ability to refresh tokens is essential for maintaining an ongoing authenticated session without requiring the user to re-authenticate frequently.\n\n## Syntax\n```typescript\nasync function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string): Promise<any>\n```\nThe function takes a single parameter, `refreshToken`, which is a string containing the refresh token provided by the OAuth2 service.\n\n## Parameters\n- `refreshToken` (string): Utilized to request a new access token and potentially a new refresh token from the OAuth2 service.\n\n## Returns\nThe function returns a `Promise<any>` which resolves to an object containing the new access token and refresh token if the operation is successful. If the operation fails, the function returns `null`.\n\n## Nodes Used\n- `fetch`: This node is used to make an HTTP POST request to the Bitbucket OAuth2 token endpoint.\n- `getEnv`: Presumably a utility function, undefined within this function, to retrieve environment variables. It fetches `BITBUCKET_KEY` and `BITBUCKET_SECRET`.\n\n## Example Usage\nThe function can be employed as follows:\n```typescript\nconst refreshToken = 'your-refresh-token-here';\n\nrefreshAccessToken(refreshToken)\n  .then(tokenData => {\n    if (tokenData) {\n      console.log('New Access Token:', tokenData.newAccessToken);\n      console.log('New Refresh Token:', tokenData.newRefreshToken);\n    } else {\n      console.log('Failed to refresh token.');\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);\n  });\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n### Constructing the Request Body\nThe function begins by constructing a request body that includes the `refresh_token`, `grant_type`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` parameters. The `client_id` and `client_secret` are retrieved using the `getEnv` function with respective keys `BITBUCKET_KEY` and `BITBUCKET_SECRET`.\n\n### Sending the Request\nA POST request is then sent to the endpoint `https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token` with the constructed request body and appropriate headers (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).\n\n### Handling the Response\nUpon receiving a response, the function checks if the response is successful (`res.ok`). If successful, it extracts `access_token` and `refresh_token` from the response JSON and returns them. If the response is unsuccessful, an error message along with the response data is logged, and the function returns `null`.\n\n### Error Handling\nThe function includes a robust error-handling mechanism using a try-catch block to manage any unexpected errors that may occur during execution. Any caught errors are logged, and the function returns `null` to signal the failure of the token refresh operation.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `refreshAccessToken` function is vital for maintaining uninterrupted authenticated sessions with services like Bitbucket. For seamless functionality, ensure the `getEnv` utility is well-implemented and that `fetch` is available in your runtime environment. The function exemplifies proper error handling and clear communication of results through returned promises.\n\nFor details on other related utilities and functions, please refer to the corresponding repository paths.",
